			In 2012 I found a set of posters in Budapest that were made in the Soviet's idea of the 90s. The academic Russian soldior encapsulated themes from social structures right through to space oddities to produce a series of posters that are an exciting jumble of almost hysterical madness. By sourcing moving imagery from youtube and collaborating with a web developer I correlated the posters with moving image.
