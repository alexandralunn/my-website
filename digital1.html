			In 2012 I found a set of posters in Budapest. The Russian soldior encapsulated themes from social structures right through to space oddities to produce a series of posters that are an exciting jumble of almost hysterical madness. By sourcing moving imagery from youtube and collaborating with a web developer I correlated the posters with moving image.
