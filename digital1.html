			<p>

			In 2012 I found a set of posters on the street in Budapest. Dating back to the 1990s, The Author who was an ex Soviet soldier encapsulated themes from social structures right through to space oddities to produce a series of posters that are described as an exciting jumble of almost hysterical madness. By sourcing moving imagery that matches with the static forms depicted in his set of posters, our present and his future is brought to life on the web.
