<p align="justify">In 2012 I found a set of posters on the street in Budapest.
Dating back to the 1990s, The
Author who was an ex Soviet
soldier encapsulated themes
from social structures right
through to space oddities to
produce a series of posters
that are described as an exciting jumble of almost hysterical madness. By sourcing moving
imagery that  matches with the
static forms depicted in his
set of posters, our present and
his future is brought to life
on the web..</p>
