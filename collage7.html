                <p>Wycinanki tanslated from Polish is 'Papercuts'
In contrast with the folklore ethos, after WW2 the fall of communism enabled institutions and businesses to use wycinanki to legitimize themselves in the eyes of the public. The change from communism to capitalism brought about developments in technology such as more mass production. I have recycled these materials to make a comment on consumption which contrasts with the humble and traditional practice. the particular wycinanka here symbolise fertility, life and nature. The print in the background is a large scale insect. Whilst background has trained me to think conceptually about almost everything, I like to think that I craft and enjoy wycinanki simply because of the pleasure I experience when looking at them. </p>
